          I designed and manufactured a trunk tent initiated by my enthusiasm for camping. So I built this website to promote the product. The current website that has been released is only a small fraction of the entire project, which has the potential to be an e-commerce platform.

          The website is built using <Mark>React</Mark> and <Mark>Material UI</Mark>, and <Mark>Firebase</Mark>.

          I developed a GIS expert system by integrating machine learning models (GLM, RF, GBM) with rule-based system for improving wetland classification accuracy.
          
          I built data pipeline to download and process satellite data, derived terrain data from <mark>LiDAR</mark>, I also utilized ArcGIS Model Builder to orchestra the data processing and model running to minimize the manual work.
          The classification accuracy was increased from around 50% to 90%.
